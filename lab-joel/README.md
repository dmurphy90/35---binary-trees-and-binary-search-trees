```postOrderTraversal``` - Navigates the binary tree in the order of Left Right Root, O(n) notation

```insert``` - Allows you to enter a node with a specified value into the tree, O(log n) notation

```find``` - Finds a specified node within the tree, O(log n) notation

```remove``` - Removes the specified node from the tree and reassigns the left and right branches to compensate, O(log n) notation

```isBalanced``` - Assesses the depth of the tree on both sides to find if the tree is balanced, or if both sides are within 1 level of each other. O(n) notation.
